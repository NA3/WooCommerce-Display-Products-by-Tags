# Contribute To WooCommerce Display Products by Tags

Community made patches, bug reports and contributions are always welcome and are crucial.

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that I can keep on top of things.

__Note:__

GitHub is for *bug reports and contributions only* - if you have a support question or a request, don't post here. Use the [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-display-products-by-tags) for community support.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * https://github.com/seb86/WooCommerce-Display-Products-by-Tags/issues
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know that has the issue.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Make the changes to your forked repository
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).**
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no crazy Windows line endings. :)
* When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about the fix
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'dev' branch of the WooCommerce Display Products by Tag repository.
* Please **don't** modify the changelog - this will be maintained by me.

At this point you're waiting on me to merge your pull request. I'll review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.
